## Context

### Purpose

People adjacent to data science (data engineers, data scientists, data analysts, business
analysts) are usually not familiar with the concepts of Supply Chain attacks or
securing their credentials. The purpose of this repository is to showcase an
example of how an attacker could steal unencrypted SSH keys from someone's
environment using an R package with very little dependencies and sending it to a
Flask API to be stored and processed.
